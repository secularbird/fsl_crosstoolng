      This will make use of the new headers_install rule in recent kernels.
      This is most probably what you want to use.

      If you have some pre-installed kernel headers lying around, you can
      enter the path to these headers, below, they will be copied from
      there, and into the toolchain's sysroot.
      
      Note:
      This will *not* let you use a complete kernel tree!
      If you want to use your own full kernel tree, then you want to
      say 'Y' to KERNEL_LINUX_INSTALL, above, and select KERNEL_LINUX_CUSTOM.

      The Linux 2.6.35 tree is a "longterm" maintenance branch.
      
      It is intended to fill the niche for users who are not using distribution
      kernels but want to use a regression-free kernel for a longer time.
      
      Critical bug fixes to later 2.6 releases are often ported to this branch
      which makes 2.6.35 a very useful base for many embedded developers seeking
      stable APIs or those who do not need the latest bleeding edge features.
      
      ... and no, this kernel has not undergone any specific QA testing.

      If you say 'n' here, the path above is expected to point to a directory

      If you say 'y' here, then the path above is expected to point to a
      tarball of such a directory.
      
      Eg., if your headers are available in: /foo/bar/buz/my_hdrs/include,
      say 'n' here, and enter: /foo/bar/buz/my_hdrs below.
      
      Now, passing a tarball around is easier than passing a directory, so
      if you want to, you can make a tarball of /foo/bar/buz/my_hdrs/include,
      say 'y' here, and enter the path to this tarball below.
